# One night I will stop dreaming of my dead hamster

This is a little project I created during a Digital Typography workshop with Klasse Digitale Grafik. 

Initially, my project explored the relationship between word placement and overall meaning within a text. 
I wanted to understand how small changes, such as the removal of a single word or shuffling the words order could alter the meaning of the entire text. 
If you remove one word is it still the same text? Or does it takes on a new meaning?

However, as the project progressed, it evolved into a platform where people could share something they want to let go of(e.g. dreaming of a dead hamster).
Users would input their text, and then by clicking on each word, they could make it disappear and see how the text would slowly lose its original meaning,
perhaps adding a new perspective or helping to let go of the situation.
