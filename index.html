        Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay Hypertext Gardens appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was
        part of the early hypertext crowd â€“ the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.

        While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal
        internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.
        To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the
        nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.

        The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by
        WikiGardeners and WikiGnomes. These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also
        providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

        In all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term.

        There are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether
        it's worthy of a new label at all. What exactly makes a website a digital garden as opposed to just another
        blog?

        After reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of
        the best examples, I've identified a few key qualities they all share.

        There are a few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around. This amounts to a
        kind of digital gardening Pattern Language.

        Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.

        This patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or
        Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them
        actively fight against it.

        If any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the
        span of humanity). None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a
        transferable format.
